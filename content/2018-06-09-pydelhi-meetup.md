It was a hot Saturday afternoon and still quite a lot tech enthusiasts and Python lovers gathered together at Fueled, Noida for the PyDelhi Meetup. The meetup, as usual, started with the quick and interactive introductory session where each person gave his/her intro. [Vipul Gupta](https://twitter.com/vipulgupta2048), the host then gave a formal introduction about PyDelhi, talking about the various aspects of it. After which, we started with the talks. The first talk was given by Yug Khanna on the topic Introduction to Machine Learning & Deep Learning. He started the talk with the basics of the Python Libraries like Pandas and Numpy. Next, he proceeded to graph plotting libraries like Plotly and cufflinks and showed examples where he plotted graphs using these libraries in Jupyter Notebook. He explained how to get the HTML output of these graphs too. In the second part, he explained about Deep Learning where he explained Binary and Logistic Regression and their mathematical formulas using the famous Recognition of cat example. He ended the talk by telling about the uses of ML in daily life and answering numerous questions thrown by the gathering that was listening to the topic very intently. You can view the slides [here](https://prezi.com/p/wihqljm-gapk/ds-and-dl-9th-june-2018/).

Then we had a snacks break for half an hour where people got the chance to interact with each other, network and discuss more with each other. [Shashank Kumar](https://twitter.com/realslimshanky) and [Vipul Gupta](https://twitter.com/vipulgupta2048) in the break took a small informal session about volunteering at Pydelhi and how we can contribute to it and also briefing about Google Summer of Code and how they contributed to the organization and their experience and journey till then. Later Yug who was also a Google Summer of Code student gave his views on the topic. Upcoming [PyCon India 2018](https://in.pycon.org/2018/) was also briefly mentioned.

For the second talk, [Shashank Kumar](https://twitter.com/realslimshanky) invited Satwik Kansal for his talk about Understanding Strings in Python. This talk gets quite interactive as Satwik has lots of tricky questions to ask from all the Python enthusiasts. Starting with basics of what exactly a string is in Python to going to deeper depths like concatenation, implicit string interning, constant folding, best ways to make a big string and different ways to concatenate strings. He tried answering every possible query from the huge audience. You can view the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aE0QmLDffyGRvChqhxaSUWEtBkDqZH5NR3in5FBOPlc/edit#slide=id.g3b7b93b895_0_88). 

Then as with every meetup, Shashank told us about Lightning talks and asked people to share their experience. In the end, the meetup ended with a Hiring and Pitching session where people from different organizations or individuals pitch about their ideas and information about job openings. So another meetup wrapped up with this and will join in the DevSprint on June 23, 2018, at 91, Springboard.
